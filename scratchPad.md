# EES Terminology

## Explosive Safety Observer
Located on premise and they're responsible for all the explosive operations within an installation. ESO has to review all of the sites on his installation and makes sure everything is correct. If a new building is built since the last inspection, he'll be required to add that data to the documentation. One ESO for each installation, and the ESO can change.

## Inspector
Creates an ESI, the inspection. 50 installation, military base. 50% done one year, other 50% done the next. Creates the reports for inspections. Inspector does not give any information to ESO except that an inspection will occur or whether or not the information is updated and correct prior to inspection. Inspector will have a list of questions for ESO to answer.The ESO will see this process once every two years. Will identify all the sites on the installation to inspect, and will create a todo list based on this information. Multiple inspectors can go to the same site.

## Installation
A base which is comprised of sites.

## ESI (inspection)
Created at the beginning of the year. All reports created for every installation. Then kicked off to the ESO.

## Site inspection
Going to the physical location and reviewing/observing all the information within site. A single site inspection occurs for just a few minutes. Documents associated with sites.

## Exposed site (ES) and potentially explosive site (PES)
ES is defined as inspection sites and PES defined as sites exposed due to ES. When expecting ES all information regarding associated PES must be correct, as well the PES of a PES that is also an ES.

## Master inspection list
Contains list of sites. All the inspectors will have this list. Essentially done with process until inspection. Basic book keeping may occur before actual inspection.

## Risk Assessment Code
How bad is the violation of site. Assigned at the time of inspection, but could go back to revise based on what inspectors saw. Adds up to a certain ammount which can potentially put ESO in a bad place.

# Recommended EES app features

1. Dashboard for the ESO where they can review sites and upload documents. 
2. Email notification system to remind ESO 30 days prior to inspection to remind them to complete their required tasks.
3. Progress bar that tracks how far the ESO progressed in preparation for inspection.
4. Visual drag and drop method to add sites for inspection.
5. Allow sites to be filtered/sorted based on various criteria, i.e. sort by when a site was last inspected.
6. Access to master inspection list as well as ability to print said list. Essentially a todo list.
7. Notifications to ESO that inspector is on base.
8. Account for lack of internet during inspection, so allow informationt to be downloaded to system.
9. Tie into eQual to verify whether personnel has their required explosive certs.
10. Notes on previous inspections
11. Taking photos
12. Explosive range information
13. Compensatory measures

# Weekly higlight for 6/21/2017

On 6/21/17 RS46 and AR30 developers completed the first sprint for Environmental and Explosives Safety (EES) web app. EES is an app that facilitates the requirement by the DoD, Navy, and Marine Corps Orders and Directives that environmental and explosives safety documentation and inspections are tracked and maintained. At this point EES is the third app to reside within the new MAKE portal. The first sprint marked the completion of the inspection creation process including a user friendly TurboTax/wizard design approach.

To fix this:
1. click on gear icon in upper right next to user name, then click “site settings”.

# Weekly Highlight 2017-08-02

This week NSWC Corona developers will conclude a sprint in regards to the Conventional Ammunition Procurement Management (CAPM) web application for the USMC Marine Ammunition Knowledge Enterprise portal. The sprint brings added functionaliy that allows users to view USMC ammunition budget statistics via interactive sand charts and export PP2 data for the Army to determine how much ammuntion they can provide to the Marines based on the Marine Corps' budget.

completed the third sprint of the Environmental and Explosives Safety (EES) web application for the USMC Marine Ammunition Knowledge Enterprise portal.  In accordance with customer request, the added functionality allows users designated as Explosive Safety Officers (ESOs) to access information on the military bases under their inspection. Details include the information on facilities that require inspection,  previous inspection findings, and documents and notes pertaining to each facility.

This week NSWC Corona developers completed the third sprint of the Environmental and Explosives Safety (EES) web application for the USMC Marine Ammunition Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) portal. In accordance with customer request, the added functionality allows end users designated as Inspectors to add, edit or delete findings associated with an Explosive Site Inspection (ESI). Aditionally, in accordance to customer request, the sprint adds a visually attractive, concise and clear indicator for displaying the extent of a facilty's violation. 

Met with comptroller to discuss FIAR compliance of the 1App suite of applications and potential use as the default tool of its type for NAVSEA.
